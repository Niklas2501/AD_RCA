Note that the values of the SI / ST metrics in some of these logs do not correspond to calculation method used in the final evaluation.
If this is the case, the detailed output of SI/ST for the best run at the end was removed, the columns in the overview are still contained though.
However, this does not influence the results since no selection was based on these values.
